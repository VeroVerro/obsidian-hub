We think of this vault as a [[Digital garden]]. This means that the content in our vault is very much a work in progress. Since we're at a very early stage, there's a lot of space to grow! You can check out a few sample notes here:

- [[Obsidian October 2021]]
- [[üóÇÔ∏è 02.01 Plugins by Category|Plugin Categories]]
- [[for Plugin Developers|Resources and Guides for Plugin Developers]]
- [[for Theme Designers|Resources and Guides for Theme Designers]]
- [[How to update your plugins and CSS for live preview]]
- [[How to Style Obsidian]]
- [[YT - How to use QuickAdd|How to use QuickAdd]]

You can also take a look at the (auto-generated) index for our vault:
